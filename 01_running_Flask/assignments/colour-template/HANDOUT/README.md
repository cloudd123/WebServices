# COLOUR TEMPLATE

Modify the simple template to support colour: a colour for the page background and another colour for the title. The title itself can just be the name (or the hex code) of the text colour.

URLs are of the form:

        http://localhost:8080/coloured/black,red
        
The two colours are named in the last part of the URL, separated by a comma. The first colour is the text, while the second colour is the background.

Think about what should happen if only one colour is specified (i.e. no comma). What if there are no colours at all?
